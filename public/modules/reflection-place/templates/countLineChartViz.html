      The line chart depicts the way your ideas fluctuated over time.
      This graph is based on the five different questions in each log post
      where each answer is thought of as a distinct category. Each line
      is graphed based on the length of the category - the number of characters in
      the response to the question. Time is the scaled to intuitively suggest a
      change over a period of time.
