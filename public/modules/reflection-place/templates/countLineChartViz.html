  The line chart depicts the way your ideas fluctuated over time.
  This graph is based on the five different questions in each log post
  where each answer is thought of as a distinct category. Each line
  is graphed based on the length of the category - the number of characters in
  the response to the question. Time is the scaled to intuitively suggest a
  change over a period of time.
